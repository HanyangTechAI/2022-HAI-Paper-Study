# Learning to Reconstruct 3D Human Pose and Shape via Model-fitting in the Loop

## 모델 기반 3차원 자세 추정 방법
1. Optimization-based methods
- 장점: accurate imagemodel alignments
- 단점: slow and sensitive to the initialization

2. Regression-based methods
- 특징: use a deep network to directly estimate the model parameters
- 장점: tend to provide reasonable pose
- 단점:not pixel accurateneeds huge amounts of supervision

=> 두가지 방법을 collaboration

3. SPIN(SMPL oPtimization IN the loop)
- regressed estimate from the network: initialize the iterative optimization ->  faster and more accurate fitting
- iterative optimization: act as strong supervision for the network
- self-improving
